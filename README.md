### How many brazilians are considered poor?
More than fifty million, says the brazilian Applied Economics Research Institute (IPEA). The Ministry of Planning's institute lauched this year the Social Radar 2005, a research aiming to understand the regular brazilian income level, based on data from IBGE, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The result shows that 53.9 million brazilians live in poverty. This is 31.7% the country's population. And in this number there's even more worrysome data: from this total, 21.9 million people are indigent. (Mundo Estranho, Aug/2016)

After four years of decrease, the percentage of families living with less than 1/4 of the minimum wage per capita increased to 9.2% after 8% in 2014 (G1, Dec/2016)

I know, almost no one have it easy. But, for many of us, it's basically impossible. We hope the government takes responsibility for those cases, but the government can be irresponsible.

These numbers are people. People that live in inhuman conditions. People that you do not see, because they are not on Facebook, or on WhatsApp.

These are not people that can't afford to go out this weekend, or can't buy nutella, because money is a little tight. These are people that can't buy plain rice. These are people that do not have a stove to cook this rice. These are people that have no shower, no electricity.

These are people waiting for a miracle, because life – and us, the society – has not left any other alternative for them.

The miracle does not have to come from our governments. The miracle does not have to come from one (or more) divine forces. You can be a part of this miracle.

# What is The Miracle?

The miracle is a platform that shows the people in need in your whereabouts, and makes it easy for you to help them:
- Donating materials, services (and money, in the future. It is usually tricky to deal with money, but it seems like the easier way to collaborate);
- Giving them job or learning opportunities;
